MicroPub support for Static Blog Engine
=======================================

This basis php script provides micropub support for the [Hugo Static Blog Engine](https://gohugo.io). Incoming posts are rewritten to a [YAML-header Hugo Format](http://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/) and saved to the user's content store.

Installation
------------

Clone the contents into the `static` folder of your Hugo installation.

This is an early WIP.

TODO
----

* [ ] Actually get the content to save in the correct format.
* [ ] Trigger Hugo on succesful operation
